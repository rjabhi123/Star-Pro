# Project Motivation
This project part of my Data Science Nanodegree, and the objective is to try to find how Starbucks customers use the app, and how well is the current offers system. more importantly, to find patterns and show when and where to give specific offer to a specific customer.
  
# File Descriptions
This repo contains 4 files :  

The report of my project is called 'Starbucks Capstone Challenge - Using Starbucks app user data to predict effective offers .ipynb'.

The data used in the project is in the files portfolio.json, profile.json and transcript.json.
