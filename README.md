# Udacity-Satrbucks-Capston-Pro
This is a Udacity Starbucks Capston Project

# Introduction

### This repository has all the code and report for my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone project

   This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app.
   Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement 
   for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer 
   during certain weeks.
