# Udacity-Starbucks-Capston-Pro
This is a Udacity Starbucks Capston Project

# Introduction
It is the Starbucks Capstone Challenge of the Data Scientist Nanodegree in Udacity. In this project, we will explore the data provided by Starbucks and the given data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offers during certain weeks.
   
# Required Libraries
This project was written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook on Anaconda. The relevant Python packages for this project are as follows :

  * Numpy
  * Pandas
  * matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * sklearn
  
# Project Motivation
This project part of my Data Science Nanodegree, and the objective is to try to find how Starbucks customers use the app, and how well is the current offers system. more importantly, to find patterns and show when and where to give specific offer to a specific customer.
  
# File Descriptions
This repo contains 4 files :  

The report of my project is called 'Starbucks Capstone Challenge - Using Starbucks app user data to predict effective offers .ipynb'.

The data used in the project is in the files portfolio.json, profile.json and transcript.json.
 
# Results
The main results of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@rabhimanyu509/starbucks-project-9ca045b6a66c).
  
# Acknowledgements
I want to thank the Udacity Data Science Nano-Degree Program for giving me this opportunity to do the project.
